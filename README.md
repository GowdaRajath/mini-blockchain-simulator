# Mini-blockchain-simulator
Educational mini blockchain implementation in Python with simple transaction + mining logic.

This project is an educational blockchain implementation built from scratch in Python.
It demonstrates how blocks, hashes, proof-of-work mining, and simple transactions operate inside a minimal blockchain system.

Tech Stack
----------
1. Python 3.x

2. hashlib for hashing

3. json for block serialization

4. Flask (optional, for API layer)


Features (Planned & In Progress)
------------

Create a blockchain with a genesis block

Add new blocks with transaction data

Proof-of-Work mining algorithm

Basic transaction structure (sender, receiver, amount)

Ledger updating based on block contents

Validation function to verify full chain integrity

Optional REST API to interact with the blockchain

Clear console output for visualising block history
